# Class notebooks for hCmpVsn (Computer Vision) course
- These notebooks are entirely rewritten to work locally in Jupyter Lab + TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)
- There is no reliance on Google Cloud services or storage.
- Consequently, many topics are radically different, while others vary from the code in the textbook, by design.
- Additional topics have been added, and others modified to match the course focus.
- For ease, I've kept the same folder structure used in the original notebooks.
- Instructions for using these notebooks is included in the daily slide decks for the course.
