# Class notebooks for hCmpVsn (Computer Vision) course
- These notebooks are entirely rewritten to work locally in Jupyter Lab + TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) without relying on Google Cloud whatsoever.
- As a result, many topics are radically different, while others vary from the code mentioned in the textbook (this is by design).
- For ease, I've kept the same folder structure used in the original notebooks.
